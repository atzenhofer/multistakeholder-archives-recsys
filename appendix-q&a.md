## 1. General Information about Recommender Systems (RecSys)

### What is a RecSys?

- RecSys are **algorithms and techniques** that suggest relevant items to users based on various factors such as preferences, contextual information, or past behavior  
- They help users **discover content** they might be interested in but wouldn't necessarily search for directly  
- Common **commercial examples** include social media, e-commerce or movies of music streaming services.

### How is a RecSys different from simple search?

- Search requires users to know what they're looking for and actively query the system, but RecSys proactively suggests content without requiring explicit queries  
- While search is focused on finding specific information, **RecSys enables exploration**, discovery, and serendipitous encounters with content  
- RecSys considers **relationships between items, user behavior patterns, and contextual factors**. Among other factors, it can incorporate user history, preferences, and behavior patterns to 'personalize' suggestions

### Where are RecSys already being used in research contexts?

- RecSys are already widely implemented for secondary literature and research materials:  
  - Academic databases suggest related articles  
  - Digital libraries recommend books and papers based on reading history  
  - Research platforms suggest relevant publications and potential collaborators  
  - Even conversational AI systems function as a kind of RecSys for information  
- However, RecSys for primary sources and cultural heritage data are  unexplored:  
  - Barely any digital archives of primary historical materials use recommendation techniques at all  
  - The characteristics of cultural heritage data (historical context, provenance, documentation) present both challenges and opportunities  
  - This gap represents an important area for innovation that could significantly enhance research

### Why are RecSys generally relevant, and specifically for cultural heritage?

- **General relevance**: In today's information-rich world, RecSys help users navigate large content collections, discover relevant items, and manage information overload  
- **For cultural heritage**: [ANONYMIZED]

## 3. About This Research Study

### What is the goal of the study?
- To identify and better consider stakeholder values for RecSys in digital archives  
- To provide guidance for designing RecSys that balance diverse needs and interests  
- To develop potential metrics for evaluating these systems based on stakeholder input  
- To understand potential conflicts between different stakeholder values  
- To create a framework that can be applied to other cultural heritage platforms  
- To contribute to the growing field of value-aware and multi-stakeholder RecSys

### Why study multi-stakeholder interests?

- Traditional RecSys often focus primarily on end-users, but many other stakeholders are affected by recommendations  
- In cultural heritage contexts—specifcally archives—stakeholders include content creators, archivists, platform owners, researchers, educators, funding agencies, and many more.
- **Each stakeholder** group likely has **different values**, priorities, and metrics for success  
- By involving diverse stakeholders in the design process, we can ensure that systems respect critical perspectives and ethical considerations  
- This approach moves **beyond traditional metrics** (like clicks or purchases) to better consider scholarly, educational, and cultural values.  

## 4. Possible Values to Consider in RecSys

*The following are possible values that might be relevant for recommender systems, based on literature review and preliminary analysis. These are provided as reference material to help guide discussion, but you are encouraged to speak intuitively about what matters most to you. You may refer to these categories if helpful, but are not limited to them. The list does not claim to be complete.*

### Functional Values
Core system capabilities and performance that determine how well the RecSys fulfills its intended purpose:

- **Relevance**: How well recommendations match user needs and goals
- **Diversity**: Variety in recommended content across different dimensions
- **Coverage**: Comprehensiveness of recommendations across the available content space
- **Novelty**: Suggesting content users haven't encountered before
- **Serendipity**: Enabling unexpected but valuable discoveries
- **Context awareness**: Understanding situational and domain-specific relationships
- **Quality**: Prioritizing high-quality content appropriate to the domain


### User Experience Values
Aspects that shape how users interact with and perceive the recommendation system:

- **Convenience**: Ease of use and integration with existing workflows
- **Engagement**: Meaningful and sustained interaction with content
- **Satisfaction**: Overall positive experience with the recommendation process
- **Learning**: Educational or developmental benefits from recommendations
- **Adaptability**: System responsiveness to changing user contexts and expertise
- **Personalization**: Tailoring recommendations to individual user characteristics

### Responsibility Values
Ethical and social obligations that ensure the system operates with integrity:

- **Transparency**: Openness about how recommendations are generated
- **Explainability**: Ability to understand why specific items are recommended
- **Accountability**: Clear responsibility for recommendation outcomes and processes
- **Fairness**: Equitable treatment across different content sources and user groups
- **Trust**: Confidence in the system's reliability and integrity
- **Privacy**: Protection of user data and behavior information
- **Objectivity**: Balanced presentation without inappropriate bias

### Human/Social Values
Values that recognize the human dimension and social impact of recommendations:

- **Autonomy**: Supporting users' freedom to make independent choices
- **Equity**: Fair distribution of benefits across different user populations
- **Dignity**: Respecting the inherent worth and agency of all users
- **Well-being**: Contributing positively to users' intellectual or emotional state
- **Social connection**: Facilitating meaningful interactions between users
- **Interpretive freedom**: Supporting multiple approaches, viewpoints, perspectives

### Technical Values
System design and implementation considerations that enable effective operation:

- **Scalability**: Handling growing content collections and user bases
- **Performance**: Efficient and responsive system operation
- **Maintainability**: Sustainable long-term system development and support
- **Robustness**: Reliable operation across different conditions and usage patterns
- **Adaptability**: Technical flexibility to accommodate changing requirements
- **Resource efficiency**: Responsible use of computational and human resources

*Note: These values often interact with each other in complex ways—sometimes reinforcing one another, sometimes creating tensions that require careful balancing. Different stakeholders may prioritize different values, and what matters most will depend on your specific perspective and context.*
