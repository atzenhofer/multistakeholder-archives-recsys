*Submitted to RecSys 2025*

## Repository Contents

This repository provides transparency into our research methodology and findings, with a focus on the multistakeholder focus groups that form the foundation of our proposed evaluation framework.

### Structure

- **[`appendix-stakeholders.md`](appendix-stakeholders.md)**: Detailed information about the 25 high-profile domain experts who participated in our focus groups, including their roles, expertise, career stage, and region (anonymized).
- **[`appendix-focus-groups.md`](appendix-focus-groups.md)**: Essentials of methodology for our focus group study, including session structure, discussion materials, and analysis approach.

Additional materials related to our research findings and evaluation framework are described in the paper.

## Research Overview

Our study addresses the challenge of translating diverse stakeholder values into concrete evaluation metrics for recommender systems in digital archives. Unlike commercial platforms where engagement metrics often suffice, cultural heritage domains serve stakeholders with competing values that standard metrics cannot capture.

### Methodology

We conducted structured focus groups with five stakeholder groups:
- **Upstream**: Archivists, curators, librarians
- **Provider**: Aggregators, digitization services
- **System**: Owners, developers, moderators
- **Consumer**: Researchers, educators, students
- **Downstream**: Publishers, educational platforms

Each group included five domain experts (N=25), partly representing major institutions connected to Monasterium.net. This ensures findings represent the broader cultural heritage community.

Sessions explored three topics identified as priority areas in previous research:
1. Visibility/representation
2. Expertise adaptation
3. Transparency/trust

### Key Contributions

1. The first multistakeholder focus group study in cultural heritage, incorporating perspectives beyond RecSys end-users
2. The first value-driven RecSys evaluation framework for digital archives that addresses the challenges of scholarly recommendation contexts
3. A systematic approach for generating RecSys evaluation metric setups that identifies key measurement dimensions and value trade-offs
