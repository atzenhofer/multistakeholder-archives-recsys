## Repository Contents

This repository provides transparency into our research methodology and findings, with a focus on the multistakeholder focus groups that form the foundation of our proposed evaluation setup. All materials have been carefully anonymized to protect author anonymity and participant privacy while maintaining methodological transparency.

### Files and Structure

- **[`appendix-stakeholders.md`](appendix-stakeholders.md)**: Detailed information about the 25 high-profile domain experts who participated in our focus groups, including their roles, expertise, career stage, and region.
- **[`appendix-q&a.md`](appendix-q&a.md)**: Background materials shared with focus group participants, organized into five key value categories.
- **[`appendix-presentation.md`](appendix-presentation.md)**: Core presentation materials including discussion scenarios, (provocative) statements, and questions used across all stakeholder groups.
- **[`appendix-consent-form.md`](appendix-consent-form.md)**: Research consent procedures and data protection information used in the study.

While full transcripts cannot be shared due to anonymity commitments, the provided materials enable other researchers to better understand our methodology and evaluate our findings. Additional information related to our research are described in the paper.

## Research Overview

Our study addresses the challenge of translating diverse stakeholder values into evaluation setups and towards metrics for recommender systems in digital archives. Unlike commercial platforms where engagement metrics often suffice, cultural heritage domains serve stakeholders with different (competing) values and objectives which traditional means of evaluation arguably do not capture.

### Participants and Stakeholder Groups

We conducted structured 60-minute focus groups with five stakeholder groups (N=25), each including five domain experts partly representing major institutions connected to Monasterium.net:

| Group | Role | Examples |
|-------|------|----------|
| **Upstream** (U1-U5) | Archivist, Curator, Librarian | Archive directors, digital curators, library research heads |
| **Provider** (P1-P5) | Manager, Specialist, Researcher | IT managers, archival specialists, data integration experts |
| **System** (S1-S5) | Developer, Director, Specialist | Core developers, system directors, information retrieval specialists |
| **Consumer** (C1-C5) | Researcher, Educator, Student | Senior researchers, doctoral students, educators |
| **Downstream** (D1-D5) | Publisher, Editor, Technologist | History professors, project editors, platform coordinators |

Complete stakeholder profiles with expertise, career stages, and regional distribution are provided in [`appendix-stakeholders.md`](appendix-stakeholders.md).

### Methodology

**Study Design**: Structured focus groups held in March 2025, with each session lasting 60 minutes and following a consistent format across all stakeholder groups.

**Session Structure**:
- **Introduction and Context** (10 minutes): RecSys fundamentals, stakeholder mapping, value set
- **Scenario-Based Discussions** (45 minutes): Three thematic discussion topics
  - Topic 1: Visibility and Representation (15 minutes)
  - Topic 2: Adaptation and Access (15 minutes) 
  - Topic 3: Transparency and Trust (15 minutes)
- **Conclusion** (5 minutes): Next steps and closing remarks

**Discussion Materials**: Each scenario was supported by visual materials and real-world examples. The same core questions were used across all stakeholder groups while provocative statements were tailored to match each stakeholder role.

Parts of presentation materials including detailed scenarios, discussion questions, and all provocative statements are provided in [`appendix-presentation.md`](appendix-presentation.md).

**Value Set**: We employed a consistent five-category value set throughout the study:

- **Functional**: relevance, diversity, novelty etc.
- **User Experience**: satisfaction, engagement, convenience etc.
- **Responsibility**: fairness, transparency, trust etc.
- **Human/Social**: equity, dignity, autonomy etc.
- **Technical**: personalization, efficiency, scalability etc.

The complete set with descriptions is provided in [`appendix-q&a.md`](appendix-q&a.md), which was shared with participants well before the focus group.

### Analysis Approach

We analyzed transcripts using an abductive coding approach, combining deductive coding (using pre-established value categories) with inductive analysis to identify emerging patterns:

1. **Initial Coding**: Applied value (sub-)categories deductively while remaining open to emerging themes
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identified recurring references to research and interaction stages
3. **Secondary Coding**: Examined how values related to different stages of user research flows
4. **Cross-Stakeholder Analysis**: Identified patterns and tensions across stakeholder groups
5. **Framework Development**: Values naturally aligned with four sequential stages we termed the "research funnel": discovery, interaction, integration, and impact

The analysis revealed both convergent themes across stakeholder groups and specific tensions between different stakeholder priorities.

### Key Contributions

1. The first multistakeholder focus group study in cultural heritage, incorporating perspectives beyond RecSys end-users
2. The first value-driven RecSys evaluation framework for digital archives that addresses the challenges of scholarly recommendation contexts
3. A systematic approach for generating RecSys evaluation metric setups that identifies key measurement dimensions and value trade-offs
