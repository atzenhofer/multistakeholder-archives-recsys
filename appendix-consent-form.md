# Appendix: Information on Data Processing and Consent

*This document represents the consent procedures used in our focus group study. All personal and institutional identifiers (or references) have been removed for anonymization purposes.*

## Introduction

[ANONYMIZED] values your privacy and processes your personal data in compliance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and beyond.

Your Personal Data is any information related to you. Processing is any operation performed on the data.

According to the Transparency Principle, this document will provide you with information about the processing of your personal data as required by Art. 12, 13, and 14 of the GDPR.

## Who is the researcher and how can you contact them?

**Name:** [ANONYMIZED]
**Address:** [ANONYMIZED]
**E-mail:** [ANONYMIZED]
**Alternative** **E-mail:** [ANONYMIZED]

acting as the data controller within the meaning of the GDPR.

## For what purpose will your data be processed?

Your data will be processed within [ANONYMIZED].

**Project description:**  
This study investigates how to design effective recommendation systems for digital archives by understanding stakeholder values and perspectives. Through focus group discussions, the researcher aims to identify the core values that stakeholders consider important in content recommendations, including aspects such as fairness, diversity, relevance, transparency, and accessibility. The insights gathered will be used to co-design appropriate metrics based on these identified values. The data collected during these focus groups may be used in [ANONYMIZED]. The data will not be used beyond the scope of this project.

**Note on Consent:** By receiving this document, participating in the scheduled focus group session (logging into the Zoom meeting), and not explicitly withdrawing consent via email or verbal communication, you are considered to have given your consent to the data processing described in this document. No additional physical signature is required if you choose to provide consent through your participation.

## What information about you will be collected and processed?

The following types of information about you are collected and processed within the project:

- Name, surname  
- IP address  
- E-mail address  
- Affiliation / professional situation / occupation

If not by correspondence, the data are collected directly from you through video interview (=focus group). Your IP address is automatically collected, but not saved, when you connect to the website.

## Video Conferencing Tool and Additional Data Processing

This research uses Zoom as the video conferencing tool for conducting focus group interviews. By participating in this research, you consent to:

1. **Zoom Data Processing**: The processing of telemetrics, metadata, and other technical data that occurs through the use of Zoom. This includes connection information, device data, and usage statistics that Zoom collects during meetings.  
     
2. **Recording Consent**: The recording of the focus group session for research purposes. While the researcher will primarily use local recordings stored locally, Zoom's cloud recording may be used as a backup if technical issues occur with the local recording.  
     
3. **International Data Processing**: Zoom may process and temporarily store certain metadata and technical information outside the European Economic Area. Zoom is registered as an active participant in the EU-US Data Privacy Framework. More details about this framework are provided in the section "Will your data be transferred outside the European Economic Area (EEA)?" below.  
     
4. **Security Measures**: Zoom employs various security measures including encryption, meeting passwords, and waiting rooms to protect participant data. All meetings will be password-protected and use waiting room features to ensure only invited participants can join.

The use of Zoom for this research has been evaluated in accordance with several (institutional) guidelines for third-party services, and appropriate measures have been taken to ensure compliance with data protection regulations.

## Confidentiality Agreement

By accepting this consent form and participating in the focus group sessions, you agree to maintain the confidentiality of information shared by other participants during these sessions. If another participant indicates that certain information is confidential or not to be shared outside the research context (e.g., sensitive information from their company or organization), you agree to respect this confidentiality.

## Legal basis for the processing of your data

Your data is processed on the basis of your consent (Art. 6.1(a) of the GDPR) which you give by accepting this notice. Exceptionally, where consent is not an appropriate legal basis, your personal data can also be processed on the basis of the researcher's legitimate interest in carrying out the research project. Then, the processing is based on Art. 6.1(f) of the GDPR.

## Applicable Privacy Laws

This consent form complies with the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Participants from outside the EU retain all privacy rights granted under their applicable local and national privacy laws. If you wish to exercise rights specific to privacy legislation in your jurisdiction, please contact the researcher.

## For how long will your data be kept?

Your data will be stored for as long as necessary for the fulfillment of the defined research purposes.

The session will be recorded for research purposes and subsequently transcribed. All data will be immediately pseudonymized for storage and analysis, with personal identifiers stored securely. Data retention will be limited to the duration of the research project, after which personal identifiers will be deleted.

## Will your data be shared with anyone?

Your personal data will not be shared with or disclosed to anyone except the researcher.

## Will your data be transferred outside the European Economic Area (EEA)?

While the researcher strives to keep all research data within the European Economic Area, certain technical metadata related to the Zoom platform may be processed outside the EEA. Zoom is registered as an active participant in the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, which was declared adequate by the European Commission in July 2023. This framework ensures an adequate level of protection for personal data transferred from the EU to participating US companies.

The EU-US Data Privacy Framework includes binding safeguards that:

1. Limit access to data by US intelligence authorities to what is necessary and proportionate  
2. Provide enhanced oversight of US intelligence activities  
3. Establish an independent and impartial redress mechanism, including a Data Protection Review Court

These safeguards address previous concerns about international data transfers and ensure that your data receives appropriate protection even when processed outside the EEA. For more information about the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, you may visit the European Commission's official website.

## No profiling or automated decision-making

Your data will not be used for profiling or automated decision-making purposes.

## Your rights with regards to the processing of your data

The GDPR grants you certain rights with regards to the processing of your personal data. These rights include:
